/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window or global Binding: When this "this" keyword is called in the global scope, and is not bound to anything specific, it is considered Window Bound.
* 2. Implicit - To the left! With implicit bindins you can always look to the left of the dot (.) when a method is called.
* 3. New Binding - When invoking a new object with the "this" keyword, that is considered a new binding.
* 4. Explicit - Just like it sounds, when you explicitly give the this keyword a value, that is considered explicit binding.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
